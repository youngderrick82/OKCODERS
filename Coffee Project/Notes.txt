Navbar--
    Use temp icon and make it more dynamic later.
    
    Create profile icon next to cart and make login initial:
        this isn't so important because I would rather make an actual login in system to be able to handle this.

        Use profile icon as placeholder.

        use FA regular user icon and then make solid user icon when hovered.


        Plan to make the body into a container that scrolls so that we can keep the menu and footer in place and prevent an unending scroll sesh just to get to the footer or the menu.
